Cloud Computing Path

We developed this API using Google Cloud Services.

For image storage, we use Google Cloud Storage buckets.

We employ Google Cloud Build to automate the Cloud Run revisions. Whenever we update the code and push it to GitHub, Cloud Build manages the deployment process.

We chose Google Cloud Run for this API because it offers speed and ease of use.
